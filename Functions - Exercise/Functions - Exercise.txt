  1. Smallest of Three Numbers
Write a function that receives three integers and prints the smallest number. Use an appropriate name for the function.
Examples
InputOutput2,
5,
32600,
342,
12312325,
21,
442,
2,
22  2. Add and Subtract
You will receive three integer numbers. 
Write a function sum() to calculate the sum of the first two integers and a function subtract(), which subtracts the result of the function sum() and the third integer.
Examples
InputOutput23,
6,
10191,
17,
30-1242,
58,
1000  3. Characters in Range
Write a function that receives two characters and prints on a single line all the characters in between them according to the ASCII code. Keep in mind that the second character code might be before the first one inside the ASCII table.
Examples
InputOutput'a',
'd'b c'#',
':'$ % & ' ( ) * + , - . / 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9'C',
'#'$ % & ' ( ) * + , - . / 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 : ; < = > ? @ A B
  4. Odd and Even Sum
You will receive a single number. You have to write a function, that returns the sum of all even and all odd digits from that number. 
Examples
InputOutput 1000435 Odd sum = 9, Even sum = 4 3495892137259234 Odd sum = 54, Even sum = 22  5. Palindrome Integers
A palindrome is a number, which reads the same backward as forward, such as 323 or 1001. Write a function, which receives an array of positive integers and checks if each integer is a palindrome or not.
Output
* If the current integer is a palindrome, print: "true"
* Otherwise, print: "false"
Examples
InputOutputInputOutput[123,323,421,121]false
true
false
true      [32,2,232,1010]false
true
true
falseHints

  6. Password Validator
Write a function that checks if a given password is valid. Password validations are:
* The length should be 6 - 10 characters (inclusive)
* It should consist only of letters and digits
* It should have at least 2 digits 
If a password is a valid print: "Password is valid".
If it is NOT valid, for every unfulfilled rule print a message:
* "Password must be between 6 and 10 characters"
* "Password must consist only of letters and digits"
* "Password must have at least 2 digits"
Examples
InputOutput'logIn'Password must be between 6 and 10 characters
Password must have at least 2 digits'MyPass123'Password is valid'Pa$s$s'Password must consist only of letters and digits
Password must have at least 2 digits  7. NxN Matrix
Write a function that receives a single integer number n and prints nxn matrix with that number.
Examples
InputOutput33 3 3
3 3 3
3 3 377 7 7 7 7 7 7
7 7 7 7 7 7 7
7 7 7 7 7 7 7
7 7 7 7 7 7 7
7 7 7 7 7 7 7
7 7 7 7 7 7 7
7 7 7 7 7 7 722 2
2 2  8. Perfect Number 
Write a function that receives a number and checks if that number is perfect or NOT.
A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors. That is the sum of its positive divisors excluding the number itself (also known as its aliquot sum).
Output
* If the number is perfect, print: "We have a perfect number!"
* Otherwise, print: "It's not so perfect."
Examples
InputOutput Comments6 We have a perfect number! 1 + 2 + 328 We have a perfect number! 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 141236498 It's not so perfect.Hint
Equivalently, a perfect number is a number that is half the sum of all of its positive divisors (including itself) => 6 is a perfect number because it is the sum of 1 + 2 + 3 (all of which are divided without residue).

  9. Loading Bar
You will receive a single number between 0 and 100, which is divided with 10 without residue (0, 10, 20, 30...). 
Your task is to create a function that visualizes a loading bar depending on the number you have received in the input.
Examples
InputOutput3030% [%%%.......]
Still loading...5050% [%%%%%.....]
Still loading...100100% Complete!
[%%%%%%%%%%]  10. Factorial Division
Write a function that receives two integer numbers. Calculate the factorial of each number. Divide the first result by the second and print the division formatted to the second decimal point.
Examples
InputOutputInputOutput5,
260.006,
2360.00Hints
